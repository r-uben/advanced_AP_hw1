	Equivalently for the price-dividend ratio, $pc_t$,
\begin{equation}
	\boxed{\e{pd_t} = \E_t\left[\e{m_{t+1}+\Delta d_{t+1}}\left(1+\e{pd_{t+1}}\right)\right].}
\end{equation}
For the initial values, we just compute the stead-state as we did with the price-to-consumption ratio. To do so,
\begin{equation}
	\widebar{pd} = \log\left(\frac{\e{\widebar{m}+\mu}}{1+\e{\widebar{m}+\mu}}\right).
\end{equation}
