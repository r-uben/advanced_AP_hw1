# Advanced Asset Pricing
## Homework 1

In this repository you can find my solutions for the first homework for the course in Advanced Asset Pricing given by Prof. Croce in November 2022. 

I provide a complete and detailed solution in **Main_RubenFernandez.pdf** file which has been created using the **Main_RubenFernandez.tex** file. Note that all the folders are necessary as well as the file **Main_RubenFernandez.sty**

The results have been obtained using **dynare++** implemented in **Matlab**. The file that should be used for that purpose is **Main_RubenFernandez.m**. At the top of this file, I include the paths that are necessary for the code to compile in *my* computer. Those paths should be adapted to the personal computer of the person downloading this code. When running it, the file **Main_RubenFernandez.tex** would be updated automatically. Also, the file **Main_RubenFernandez.pdf* will be open also automatically.
